# translation-service-challenge

- [x] All the required functionality is implemented 
- [x] All the non-functional requirements are followed
- [x] Followed DDD-like approach
- [x] Written some tests just to show knowledge (haven't checked them in action because already checked with API client)
- [x] Docker support added and checked
- [x] Nix flakes and dev environment support added and used for development (my personal checkmark :))
- [x] MongoDB is used as a database

NOTE: I haven't got a chance to find any legal way (such as an GCP API) to get definitions, synonyms and examples from Google Translate so I decided to use Google's LLM - Gemini that should give similar results. 

P.S. Feel free to launch the service using `docker-compose up -d` and check the Translation API with curl or any other API client.
